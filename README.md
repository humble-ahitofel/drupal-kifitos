Terms of Service agreements
===========================

Drupal 8 module that provides 'terms of services' agreements and security measures for blocking
access to routes before the terms are accepted.

This module is very light in features.

## Operating modes
There are two operating modes available: persistent banner notification and replacing page content.
It's possible to confgure route guards that prevent access to routes until terms are approved.
